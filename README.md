# Falling-Sand-Game
## An app that allows you to simulate falling sand particles that change color, built with JavaFX. Inspired by [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) video on the same topic
## Find the installer in releases (Windows only).

## Features
- Drag or click mouse to drop sand!

## Screenshots

## Future goals
- Manually change color changing rate
- Manually change sand particle size
- Add gravity physics
- Add "anti-matter particles" that destroy everything it touches on its way down!
